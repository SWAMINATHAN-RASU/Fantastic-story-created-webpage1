                 Sammy and haircuts did not get along. In fact, he decided one day that he would never 
                get another haircut again. But, soon Sammy realized that avoiding the barber, and 
                letting your hair get longer,  and longer, and longer… wasn’t all it’s cracked up to be. Turns out,
                when you can’t see what you’re eating, you might end up eating napkins instead of pancakes! And nobody 
                wants to find potato chips in their hair! This illustrated story for kids is a fun lesson for anyone
                who doesn’t like haircuts! <br><br>
            
                During the 15th and 16th centuries, European men wore their hair cropped no longer than shoulder-length,
                with very fashionable men wearing bangs or fringes. In Italy, it was common for men to dye their hair.[13]
                In the early 17th century male hairstyles grew longer, with waves or curls being considered desirable in 
                upper-class European men. <br><br>
            
                A hairstyle's aesthetic considerations may be determined by many factors, such as the subject's physical
                attributes and desired self-image and/or the stylist's artistic instincts.

                Happy Prince” is a story that explores compassion in society, serving as a fairy tale and a 
                fable at once. It’s about a prince who is only allowed to see beauty and comfort in his life. When he dies
                he’s turned into a golden statue in his city, where he discovers that others actually live their lives 
                in poverty and darkness. With the help of a swallow (a type of bird), the prince manages to help people 
                even after death <br> <br>
                You may have heard of the term “mob mentality” and how it can allow for some pretty surprising
                (and terrible) things to happen. This classic story looks at society, and how much evil people are
                willing to overlook to keep their society stable. <br><br>
                This is considered to be one of the most famous short stories in American literature. It’s a great
                example of what is known as a dystopian society, where people live in a frightening way. To learn more,

            but they tap into some fundamental aspects of human psychology.
